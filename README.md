# Detecting Seismicity - EEE Final Year Project 2022

Welcome to my repository for my FYP, written in MATLAB. For my FYP, I have developed a program that is able to give an estimation of where a seismic activity such as an explosion has come from, using a single station's data. This program, uses IRIS data which is unfortunately not live, however if we assume the program to be running at the station itself, perhaps it would be possible to act as a real time source. The program, once it detects an 'extraordinary' seismic activity, such as 3Ïƒ than traditional activity during the day, it will trigger an email/text message alert.


## Requirements
- A computer with sufficient processing power to run the MATLAB code.
- MATLAB is required, as well as the libraries of ...


## Instructions on how to run.



## Repository structure
The code is organised as such:
- An unoptimised single station location program, this is the benchmark for comparison.
- A hill climb implementation.
- A grid search implementation.


Also, have the seperate optimisation algorithms to compare run times, and choose the best one.
